# Python Challenge!

### Logic
<p>My logic was all over the place during this challenge.
</br>
I used AskBCS a few times and leaned heavily on my classmates to better understand the task. 
</br>
I struggled to pseudocode each section but I put this down to lack of coding experience.
</br>
Now that I've completed it, I feel more confident in being able to break things down little by little!
</p>

<p>
I deleted a load of extra test bits of code as per grading instructions, including:
</br>
</br> <strong>PyBank</strong>
</br> - print(monthscounter + 1)
</br> - print(f"${totalprofit + int(rows[1])}")
</br> - print(totalchange / monthscounter)
</br> - print(f'{maxprofit_month} (${maxprofit})')
</br> - print(f'{minprofit_month} (${minprofit})')
</br>
</br> <strong>PyPoll</strong>
</br> - print(f"CSV Header: {csv_header}")
</br> - print(Stockham_votes), print(Degette_votes), print(Doane_votes)
</br> - how to round up to %23.049?!?!
</br> - print(f'%{Doane_percent:.3f} ({Doane_votes})')
</br> - print(output)
</p>

<p>Above all, I feel happy with my results, and proud that I finally understand the logic!</p>
